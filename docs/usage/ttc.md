# Time To Compromise (TTC)

TTC estimation assigns temporal difficulty or likelihood weightings to components and transitions.

Modules:
- `TTCComputation/system_ttc.py`
- `TTCComputation/kube_ttc.py`

Current implementation derives TTC from vulnerability / misconfiguration presence and simple aggregation heuristics.
