# Time-To-Compromise Computation

`KUBE_TTC` computes the time-to-compromise for the components in the Kubernetes cluster. The computational model has been adapted to Kubernetes and was inspired by the following three TTC models:

- [Time-to-Compromise Model for Cyber Risk Reduction Estimation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-36584-8_5) by McQueen et al.
- [The Î²-Time-to-Compromise Metric for Practical Cyber Security Risk Estimation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8514838) by Zieger et al.
- [Estimating Time-To-Compromise for Industrial Control System Attack Techniques Through Vulnerability Data](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-023-01750-z) by Ling et al.
